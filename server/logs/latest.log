[00:31:06] [Server thread/INFO]: [Essentials]  "plugins/Essentials/userdata-npc-backup" folder. If you notice any files
[00:31:06] [Server thread/INFO]: [Essentials]  have been purged incorrectly, you should restore it from the backup and
[00:31:06] [Server thread/INFO]: [Essentials]  report it to us on GitHub:
